// The burn-forecast model: the error budget already says how much is gone.
// This says when it will all be gone.
//
// Those are different questions and only the second one is actionable. "You
// have used 60% of the budget" is a fact about the past; whether it is a
// problem depends entirely on whether that 60% arrived over a month or over
// the last twenty minutes. An on-call who can see "gone in about half an
// hour" can decide to act, and one looking at a percentage cannot.
//
// Holt's linear method: two numbers, a level and a trend, each an
// exponentially weighted update, and the projection is level + h·trend.
// Recent observations count for more than old ones, which is the behaviour
// wanted here — a burn that was flat all week and turned upward ten minutes
// ago should be projected from the turn, not from the week.
//
// It is graded head to head against the forecast it has to beat: assuming
// the burn stays exactly where it is. That naive persistence forecast is a
// genuinely hard baseline on slow-moving series, which is the point of
// scoring against it rather than against nothing. Every observation grades
// the previous step's two predictions before it updates either, so the win
// rate on the card is earned on data neither had seen.

	// What gates a projection is not the head-to-head win rate. That was

	// a tie that persistence wins on the tie-break, so the gate closed
	// exactly when a burn turned upward and would have needed a hundred
	// observations of sustained trend to open again — useless, since the
	// turn is the whole thing the forecast is for.
	//
	// The right test comes from what the model actually replaces, which is
	// no projection at all rather than persistence: persistence is flat by
	// construction and never reaches 100%, so it never produces an
	// exhaustion time. Any credible projection beats nothing; one fitted to
	// noise does not. So a projection is published only when the trend
	// survives its own error band — see exhaustedLocked, where the test
	// falls out of the band that is already being computed.

	// The win rate stays on the card as an honest measure of one-step
	// skill. It is information, not a gate. (There is deliberately no
	// forecastMinGraded constant here — that was the gate this comment

	// as the per-step prediction error and was originally confused with it.
	// Per-step noise does not shrink however long the model runs; the

	// away. Using the former made the band far too wide and withheld
	// projections from series with a perfectly clear trend.
