// The severity model: given a log line that arrived without a level, say
// which level it is.
//
// The agent already had an answer — four substrings, `severityOf` in the
// file-tail collector. It is wrong in both directions and cannot be fixed by
// adding more substrings: "no errors reported" and "error_rate=0" are Info
// lines containing "error", "recovered from the failure" is an Info line
// containing "fail", and a service that logs "SEVERE" or "panic:" or writes
// in a language other than English gets Info for everything. Substrings
// cannot know which words matter in *this* system.
//
// The stream already knows. Logs arriving over OTLP carry a real severity
// set by the application, and those are free labelled examples of exactly
// the vocabulary this deployment uses. So the model learns from the labelled
// half of the stream and is applied to the unlabelled half. It never trains
// on an inferred severity — that would just teach it the substring rule it
// exists to replace.
//
// Multinomial naive Bayes over hashed tokens, trained online:
//   - It is a real fit to the data, not a threshold someone chose.
//   - State is bounded and tiny regardless of how large the vocabulary gets,
//     because tokens are hashed into a fixed number of buckets.
//   - It is stdlib-only, which the forseer module must stay.
//   - It updates per line, so a deployment that starts logging a new phrase
//     today is understood today.
