# Contributing

This is Marc Fors's internal design system — the source of truth for every component every Forsight app (client or in-house) builds on. Changes here ship to every consumer, so the bar is: tested, accessible, and versioned correctly.

## Setup

```bash
nvm use          # Node version pinned in .nvmrc
npm install
npm run storybook  # component playground at localhost:6006
```

## Before opening a PR

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check     # npm run format to auto-fix
npm run test:coverage    # coverage thresholds are enforced — see vitest.config.ts
npm run build
npm run smoke             # public API + shipped CSS of the built dist/
npm run test:package      # publint + are-the-types-wrong on the packed tarball
npm run test:consumer     # packed tarball inside a real Next.js + Tailwind v4 app (fixtures/next-consumer)
npm run build-storybook
npm run size              # bundle-size budget — see the "size-limit" field in package.json
```

All of these run in CI; failing any of them blocks merge.

**Dependency bumps**: verify against the Node version in `.nvmrc` (22), not
whatever's globally installed — CI's matrix (22 & 24) is current LTS plus
current, and dev tooling does move faster than the oldest version you happen
to have. `nvm use` before testing a bump.

These are dev-toolchain versions only. The published package's own floor is
`package.json`'s `engines` (`>=18.18`), and it is deliberately lower: the
built `dist/` is ES2020 and runs anywhere, so a consumer is never asked to
upgrade Node because this repo's test runner did.

## Testing policy

Every change lands with the test that would have caught it breaking. The layers, what each one catches, and the per-change checklist live in the `testing` skill (`.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`); the policy is:

- **Coverage is a floor, not a target.** `npm run test:coverage` enforces 98% statements/lines, 85% branches/functions (`vitest.config.ts`). New source files under `src/` are covered by a test that asserts something real about them — never by an `exclude` entry. The thresholds only ever go up.
- **Every public surface has a proof at its own layer.** Component behavior and accessibility → co-located `*.test.tsx` (`vitest-axe`). Rendered DOM → `src/__tests__/dom-snapshot.test.tsx`. Color pairings → `src/tokens/__tests__/contrast.test.ts`. Real-browser render + axe + `play` flows → Storybook test runner. The built artifact → `npm run smoke`. Package resolution → `npm run test:package`. A real consumer app → `npm run test:consumer`. Bundle size → `npm run size`.
- **Green everywhere before merge.** All of the above run in CI and are required status checks on `main` — a PR cannot merge with a red or stale check, and admins are not exempt.

## Regression policy

- **A bug fix ships with a failing-then-passing test** that reproduces the reported behavior at the narrowest layer that owns it. The commit message names the symptom.
- **When a check fails, find out why before touching anything.** Read the failing step's log (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`), reproduce locally with the same command, and trace the symptom to the mechanism that owns it. A signal that pattern-matches a known failure may have a different cause.
- **Fix the cause, never the signal.** Do not delete or skip a test, raise a timeout, lower a threshold, add a lint/CodeQL suppression, or ignore an advisory to turn a check green. If a check is genuinely wrong, fix the check in its own commit and say why. If the correct fix is out of scope, the PR waits — a red check is information, not an obstacle.
- **Don't change what isn't broken.** A fix touches the narrowest layer that owns the incorrect behavior and preserves unrelated behavior. Cleanup, renames and refactors go in their own PR.
- **Snapshots are reviewed, not rubber-stamped.** A DOM-snapshot diff is either an intended change (explained in the changeset) or a regression — update snapshots only after reading the diff.
- **Consumers are the last line.** Anything a consumer can observe (exports, props, tokens, CSS, the `"use client"` boundary) is covered by `npm run test:consumer` against a packed tarball; a change that alters what ships also gets a changeset (see [Versioning](#versioning)).

## Security & code-quality policy

Enforced with GitHub's own tooling; the settings side is summarized in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#how-this-repo-is-protected).

- **Findings are fixed at the source.** A CodeQL alert (`security-and-quality` suite), a Dependabot alert, or an `npm audit` high/critical is resolved by changing the code or upgrading the dependency — not by dismissing the alert or adding an ignore. The two required "Analyze (…)" checks prove the scan ran; they do not go red on a finding (the "Code scanning results / CodeQL" check reports those, and is not required), so a new alert is caught and fixed after merge by the standing mandate in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), not before it. When a transitive dependency is stuck behind a major upgrade its parent hasn't made, pin it with an `overrides` entry in `package.json` and verify the full gate still passes.
- **Every workflow declares `permissions:`** for its `GITHUB_TOKEN`, read-only unless the job needs more (release: publish + PR; Pages deploy; CodeQL: `security-events: write`).
- **Dependencies update daily and land on their own.** Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) proposes every update — patch, minor and major — grouped where a family moves together (Radix, Storybook, Vite/Vitest, ESLint); `.github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml` arms native auto-merge on each PR and keeps it up to date with `main`, so it merges the moment every required check is green. A PR that needs a real migration to go green gets that migration (see the standing mandate in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)) — never an `ignore` entry. The one exception is documented inline in `dependabot.yml`.
- **What auto-merge is gated on.** The nine required contexts listed under "`main` is protected" below — which now include the agent's `go` and `web` jobs. One gap remains: the CodeQL checks prove the scan ran rather than that it was clean, so a new finding is fixed after merge by the mandate in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) rather than blocking it. Every ecosystem also carries a Dependabot publish cooldown, so nothing merges the day it is released, and a major bump of a GitHub Action is never auto-merged.
- **Releases are continuous.** The Changesets "Version Packages" PR that `release.yml` maintains has its checks run and auto-merge armed automatically, so every changeset merged to `main` becomes a published version and a `vX.Y.Z` tag without a manual step.
- **`main` is protected**: required checks (CI matrix, consumer, storybook, audit, both CodeQL analyses, and the agent's `go`/`web` jobs) must pass on the up-to-date branch, history is linear, force-pushes and deletions are blocked, and the rules apply to admins. Auto-merge is enabled so a PR merges itself once — and only once — everything is green.
- **Secrets never enter the repo.** Secret scanning with push protection rejects a pushed credential; publishing uses the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so no long-lived token is stored anywhere.

## Adding or changing a component

> Working with Claude Code in this repo? Two project skills encode everything
> below in full: **`new-component`** (authoring one to spec) and
> **`component-audit`** (sweeping the library for a11y / responsive defects).
> They live in `.claude/skills/` and load automatically when the task matches.

Every component needs, at minimum:

- `Name.tsx` — `React.forwardRef`, variants via `class-variance-authority` where applicable, and JSDoc on the exported component describing _when_ to use each variant (this becomes both the Storybook description and, eventually, the design-agent-facing docs when this repo is synced to claude.ai/design).
- `Name.stories.tsx` — 2–5 named-export stories with realistic content (not `foo`/`bar`).
- `Name.test.tsx` — behavior tests (render, interaction) plus an accessibility check:
  ```tsx
  import { axe } from "../test-utils/axe"; // not "vitest-axe" directly — see that file for why
  expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations();
  ```
- If it introduces new color/state combinations, add the relevant fg/bg pairs to `src/tokens/__tests__/contrast.test.ts`.
- Export it from `src/index.ts`.

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) — non-negotiable, checked before merge

- **Name / role / value** on every interactive element; decorative `<svg>` gets `aria-hidden="true"`; no redundant/invalid roles.
- **Helper / error text is linked** to its control via `aria-describedby` (id from `React.useId()`), with `aria-invalid` on error — see `Input.tsx` / `Textarea.tsx`.
- **Keyboard**: fully operable; custom widgets implement their WAI-ARIA key model (Arrow/Home/End/Esc/Enter/Space) and `id`↔`aria-controls`/`aria-labelledby` wiring — see the hand-rolled `Tabs.tsx`.
- **Visible focus** via `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:shadow-focus-ring` everywhere.
- **Touch targets ≥ 24×24 px** (WCAG 2.5.8) — pad icon-only buttons; bare checkbox/radio is `h-6 w-6`.
- **Live regions** for async feedback: `role="status"` (polite) / `role="alert"` (assertive for errors) — see `Alert.tsx`.
- Reduced motion is already handled globally in `src/styles/globals.css` — don't re-implement it per component.
- The `axe` test above is the automated floor; it does not replace this checklist.

### Responsiveness — usable at 320 / 768 / 1280 px, no horizontal page scroll

- Cap fixed widths that can exceed 320px: `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`, or `max-w-[var(--radix-popper-available-width)]` for Radix poppers. `Dialog` content is `w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] max-w-md`.
- Tall overlays scroll internally (`max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto`), not off the viewport.
- Wide content (tables) lives in `<div className="w-full overflow-x-auto">`.
- Control strips wrap (`flex-wrap`) or scroll (`overflow-x-auto` + `shrink-0` children).
- No `whitespace-nowrap` on user content; add `min-w-0` to growable flex children.
- Verify in Storybook at 375px and desktop, in **both** themes — the `Forsight/Overview` "Kitchen" story is the fastest whole-system check.

### RTL (`dir="rtl"`)

- Use logical properties, not physical ones: `text-start`/`text-end` (not `text-left`/`text-right`), `ms-*`/`me-*`/`ps-*`/`pe-*` (not `ml-*`/`mr-*`/`pl-*`/`pr-*`), `start-*`/`end-*` (not `left-*`/`right-*`), `border-s`/`border-e` (not `border-l`/`border-r`). `justify-start`/`justify-end` and flex/grid item order are already logical — no change needed there.
- `translateX`/`translateY` have no logical equivalent — anything that moves an element sideways (a toggle thumb, a slide-in animation) needs explicit `ltr:`/`rtl:`-scoped values, verified by real rendered position (`getBoundingClientRect`), not `toHaveClass` — both direction's classes are always present in the DOM regardless of which one's CSS actually wins. See `Switch.tsx`'s thumb and its `Forsight/Switch` "RTL" story for the pattern.
- Centering (`left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`) and Radix's own Popper positioning (`POPPER_ANIMATION_CLASSES`'s `data-[side=...]`, which reads viewport-relative collision detection, not text direction) need no changes.
- Verify in Storybook with the toolbar's Direction toggle (or a `<div dir="rtl">` wrapper, for a fixed comparison in one story) at 375px and desktop, in both themes — `Forsight/Overview` → "KitchenSinkRTL" is the whole-system check, mirroring "Kitchen".

Overlay or positioned components (anything opening on click/hover — dialogs, menus, tooltips, popovers) should be built on a Radix UI primitive rather than hand-rolled — see any existing overlay component (`Dialog.tsx`, `Popover.tsx`) for the pattern: unstyled Radix primitive + this repo's Tailwind token classes + `POPPER_ANIMATION_CLASSES` from `src/lib/animation.ts` for open/close motion.

### Charts and observability components

- **Draw on `ChartFrame`.** It supplies the measured, responsive `<svg>` and the visually hidden data table that stands in for the picture. A plot without that table is not shippable — it is the WCAG 1.1.1 equivalent, and it is what makes the light-theme series colors permissible under the data-viz relief rule (see the comment in `src/styles/tokens.css`).
- **Geometry lives in `src/lib/chart.ts`.** Scales, path builders and formatters are pure functions with their own unit tests; components stay thin renderers over them. Add new maths there, not inline in a component.
- **Series colors are the eight `--forsight-viz-*` slots, in order, never cycled.** Do not add a ninth hue, re-order the slots, or re-step them: the ordering is what keeps adjacent series distinguishable for colorblind readers, and `src/tokens/__tests__/contrast.test.ts` pins both the 3:1 non-text contrast bar and the exact light-theme slots allowed to take relief. Past slot 8, `seriesFill`/`seriesBg` go neutral on purpose — fold the tail into "Other".
- **Never a second y-axis.** Two measures of different scale are two plots (see the `Forsight/Overview` → "Dashboard" story), small multiples, or indexed to a common base.
- **Color is never the only carrier.** Two or more series means a legend; status means a word next to the dot; a delta means an arrow _and_ the sign; a failed span means the word "error".
- **The hover layer is keyboard-reachable.** Plotted charts take focus and move their cursor with Arrow/Home/End, Escape dismisses, and the reading goes out through a polite `role="status"` region rather than the (aria-hidden) tooltip.
- Verify in the `Forsight/Overview` → "Dashboard" / "DashboardRTL" stories, which compose the whole family the way a real service dashboard does.

**Testing overlay components (Dialog, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, Select):** keep jsdom tests **structural and fast** — render with `defaultOpen` and assert roles / props / classes. Do **not** run `axe()` on an _open_ overlay in jsdom: with no layout engine it takes minutes and times out on CI. Open-state accessibility and real open/close interaction are covered by the Storybook test runner in real Chromium (`npm run test:storybook`) via the component's stories and `play` functions. `axe()` in a `*.test.tsx` is for **inline** components. See `.claude/skills/testing`.

## Versioning

> Full workflow — bump-type decision table, the release-commit shape, and the
> tag-sync check — is in the **`release`** project skill (`.claude/skills/`).

This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Any change that affects the published package (a new component, a prop change, a visual change, a bug fix) needs a changeset:

```bash
npx changeset
```

Answer the prompts: bump type (`patch` for fixes/tweaks, `minor` for new components/props, `major` for breaking changes to an existing component's API or behavior) and a summary — this text becomes the CHANGELOG entry. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file alongside your code change. Internal tooling/docs changes that don't affect consumers (CI config, `.claude/`, this file, dev dependencies) don't need one.

Cutting a release (maintainer): `npx changeset version` to bump `package.json` + rewrite `CHANGELOG.md`, then commit that alone as `chore(release): x.y.z` and tag it `git tag -a vX.Y.Z`. **Every version in `CHANGELOG.md` has a matching annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag on its release commit** — `git tag --list 'v*'` against the `## X.Y.Z` headings should never disagree. `npm run release` publishes.
